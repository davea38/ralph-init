# ralph-init - RALPH Loop Init

The re-regurgitated version. A bare bones RALPH loop for autonomous AI-driven development.

## Original Sources

This project is based on the RALPH methodology. Credit where it's due:

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ralph-init
```

That's it. Run it inside any project directory and it scaffolds the RALPH loop files. Then write specs and start looping.

## What Is This?

RALPH is a method where Claude works in a **loop**, completing one task at a time
with a fresh brain each round. Think of it like a very diligent assistant who:

1. Reads the plan
2. Picks the most important task
3. Does it
4. Updates the plan
5. Forgets everything and starts fresh (this keeps it sharp)
6. Repeats

## Files

```
ralph-init/
  loop.sh                  The engine - runs the loop
  PROMPT_plan.md           Instructions for "figure out what to do" mode
  PROMPT_build.md          Instructions for "do the work" mode
  AGENTS.md                Operational notes (starts empty, grows over time)
  IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md   The task list (generated by planning mode)
  specs/                   YOUR requirements go here (one file per topic)
```

## How To Use (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Write Your Specs

Create markdown files in `specs/` describing what you want built.
One file per topic. Keep it clear and specific.

Example: `specs/user-authentication.md`

```markdown
# User Authentication

Users should be able to:
- Sign up with email and password
- Log in and receive a session
- Log out
- Reset their password via email
```

**Tip**: If you can't describe a spec in one sentence without using "and",
split it into two specs.

### Step 2: Run Planning

```bash
./loop.sh plan
```

Claude will read your specs, look at any existing code, and create
a prioritized task list in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

Review the plan. If it looks wrong, just run planning again - plans are cheap.

### Step 3: Run Building

```bash
./loop.sh build       # runs until you stop it (Ctrl+C)
./loop.sh build 5     # runs max 5 iterations then stops
```

Claude will pick one task, implement it, test it, commit it,
and then the loop restarts with a fresh context.

**Watch the first few loops.** If Claude does something weird, add a note
to `AGENTS.md` so it learns for next time.

## Key Ideas

- **Specs** = what you want (you write these)
- **Plan** = what to do (Claude generates this from specs)
- **AGENTS.md** = how to work in this project (starts empty, grows as Claude learns)
- **One task per loop** = keeps Claude sharp and focused
- **Plans are disposable** = if the plan goes wrong, just re-run planning
